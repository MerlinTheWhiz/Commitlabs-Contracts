# Timelock Parameter Runbook

## Timelock parameter runbook

This runbook covers how to operate the on-chain `time_lock` contract safely in production-leaning environments.

## Current on-chain parameter model

`time_lock` uses fixed minimum delays by action type plus a hard global maximum:

| Action type | Minimum delay | Intended use |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `ParameterChange` | 86,400 seconds (1 day) | Routine operational parameter changes with limited blast radius |
| `FeeChange` | 86,400 seconds (1 day) | Fee schedule changes that should still allow user review |
| `AdminChange` | 172,800 seconds (2 days) | Transfer of governance authority or signer rotation |
| `Upgrade` | 259,200 seconds (3 days) | Contract code upgrades and other high-impact changes |
| Global maximum | 2,592,000 seconds (30 days) | Upper bound for any queued action |

## Operator goals

- Give users and reviewers enough time to inspect queued changes before execution.
- Match delay length to blast radius: larger governance power should mean longer delay.
- Keep delays deterministic and simple enough that downstream contracts and operators can reason about them.

## Recommended operating procedure

1. Classify the change before queueing it.
   Use `Upgrade` for code changes, `AdminChange` for authority transfers, and the narrower parameter types for operational tuning.

2. Choose a delay at or above the action minimum.
   Do not treat the minimum as the default for every change. If a parameter update could affect solvency, liquidation timing, or user withdrawal behavior, prefer a longer delay than the floor.

3. Encode the action data clearly.
   Store enough structured information in `data` for reviewers to understand the queued change without ambiguity.

4. Record the execution timestamp at queue time.
   Operators should capture the returned `action_id`, `queued_at`, and `executable_at` from `get_action(action_id)` and circulate that information internally.

5. Review before execution.
   Before executing, confirm the action is still intended, not cancelled, and that the target address and payload still match the approved change request.

6. Execute after the delay window opens.
   Execution is permissionless after `executable_at`, so any operator or automation that observes the contract can trigger it.

7. Cancel instead of superseding when intent changes.
   If the planned action is no longer correct, cancel the queued action and submit a new one rather than assuming reviewers will infer the latest intent.

## Parameter selection guidance

### `ParameterChange`

Use for lower-risk operational changes where a one-day review window is sufficient.

Choose longer than one day when:
- the parameter affects user balances or withdrawal timing
- the change interacts with liquidation or settlement paths
- the parameter is hard to roll back safely

### `FeeChange`

Use for fee schedule updates. The one-day minimum is a floor, not a recommendation for every market.

Choose longer than one day when:
- fees materially change user economics
- the fee change is bundled with another governance action
- users need advance notice for fairness or compliance reasons

### `AdminChange`

Use for signer rotation, multisig replacement, or governance transfer.

Operational guidance:
- verify the new admin can authenticate on Soroban before queueing
- use a longer delay if the change also alters operational processes or key custody

### `Upgrade`

Use for WASM upgrades or changes with equivalent blast radius.

Operational guidance:
- prefer the longest practical review window
- ensure code review, diff review, and test evidence are complete before execution
- never bundle emergency reasoning into a routine upgrade if the contract does not implement a separate emergency path

## Edge cases operators should know

- Actions become executable at exactly `executable_at`; they do not need to wait an extra ledger tick.
- Execution remains open forever after the delay unless the action is cancelled.
- Cancelled actions can never be executed.
- Executed actions can never be cancelled.
- Queueing fails if the chosen delay is below the action minimum or above the 30-day cap.

## Security notes

- Queueing and cancellation require admin authorization.
- Execution is intentionally permissionless after the delay to reduce liveness dependence on the admin.
- The contract stores metadata for queued actions but does not itself enforce off-chain review or approval workflow quality; operators must supply that process.
